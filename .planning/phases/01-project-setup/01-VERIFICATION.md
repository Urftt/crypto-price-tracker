# Phase 1: Project Setup Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Scaffold a uv-managed Python project with pyproject.toml and an installable `crypto` CLI entry point
**Verified:** 2026-03-01
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Running `uv sync` installs the project and all dependencies without error | VERIFIED | `uv sync` completed: "Resolved 1 package in 0.71ms / Audited 1 package in 0.07ms" — exit code 0 |
| 2 | Running `crypto --help` after install prints usage information and exits with code 0 | VERIFIED | `uv run crypto --help` printed full usage with description, subcommands, and options; exit code 0 |
| 3 | The project has a pyproject.toml with a [project.scripts] entry point mapping `crypto` to the CLI module | VERIFIED | `pyproject.toml` line 8-9: `[project.scripts]` / `crypto = "crypto_price_tracker.cli:main"` |

**Score:** 3/3 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `pyproject.toml` | Project metadata, dependencies, CLI entry point | VERIFIED | 17 lines; contains `[project.scripts]`, `[build-system]` (hatchling), `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]`, correct src/ layout config |
| `src/crypto_price_tracker/__init__.py` | Python package marker | VERIFIED | Exists; sets `__version__ = "0.1.0"` |
| `src/crypto_price_tracker/cli.py` | CLI entry point with main() function | VERIFIED | 25 lines; exports `main`; uses `argparse.ArgumentParser`; registers three subparser stubs; handles no-command case with `print_help()` + `SystemExit(0)` |
| `.python-version` | Python version pin for uv | VERIFIED | Contains `3.12` |
| `uv.lock` | Reproducible lockfile | VERIFIED | Exists; generated by `uv sync` |
| `.gitignore` | Excludes .venv and build artifacts | VERIFIED | Exists; created as auto-fix during plan execution |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `pyproject.toml` | `src/crypto_price_tracker/cli.py` | `[project.scripts]` crypto entry point | WIRED | Pattern `crypto = "crypto_price_tracker.cli:main"` found at line 9 of pyproject.toml; `uv run crypto --help` resolves and executes correctly |
| `src/crypto_price_tracker/cli.py` | `argparse` | `ArgumentParser` for --help output | WIRED | `import argparse` at line 1; `argparse.ArgumentParser(prog="crypto", ...)` at line 5; `--help` output confirmed via live execution |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| SETUP-01 | 01-01-PLAN.md | Project uses uv with pyproject.toml (no setup.py or requirements.txt) | SATISFIED | `pyproject.toml` present; `uv sync` works; `setup.py` absent; `requirements.txt` absent |
| SETUP-02 | 01-01-PLAN.md | CLI is installable with a `crypto` entry point command | SATISFIED | `[project.scripts] crypto = "crypto_price_tracker.cli:main"` in pyproject.toml; `uv run crypto --help` exits 0 with usage output |

No orphaned requirements: REQUIREMENTS.md maps only SETUP-01 and SETUP-02 to Phase 1, and both are claimed by the plan.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `src/crypto_price_tracker/cli.py` | 13-15 | "coming soon" in subparser help strings | INFO | Intentional by design — plan explicitly required subcommand stubs without implementation. Help text accurately describes future state. Not a blocker. |

No blockers or warnings found. The "coming soon" text is by design and correctly documented in the plan.

### Commit Verification

Both commits documented in the SUMMARY exist and are valid:

| Commit | Hash | Contents | Status |
|--------|------|----------|--------|
| Task 1: pyproject.toml and .python-version | `d556969` | `.python-version`, `pyproject.toml` | VERIFIED |
| Task 2: Python package, CLI, uv.lock, .gitignore | `a3b668b` | `__init__.py`, `cli.py`, `uv.lock`, `.gitignore` | VERIFIED |

### Human Verification Required

None. All verification items for this phase are programmatically checkable (file existence, content patterns, CLI execution, exit codes).

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. All three observable truths are fully verified against the actual codebase. Both required artifacts (pyproject.toml and Python package) are substantive and correctly wired. Both requirement IDs (SETUP-01, SETUP-02) are satisfied with direct evidence. The phase goal is achieved.
